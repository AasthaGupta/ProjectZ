Attempt to implement MultiLayer Perceptron in hardware descriptive language like VHDL.
Maybe it will work or maybe not.Who knows?

Reasons for creating it using VHDL:
-efficiency
-cost(because making things cheaper means kahi bhi use karo isse ab :P)
-aur kuch aaya reason toh add karungi.tab tak ke liye bus lag rhi hain.
